            <li>Keep fossil fuels in the ground.
               <ul>
                 <li> Fossil fuels include coal, oil and gas – and the more that are extracted and burned, the worse climate change will get. All countries need to move their economies away from fossil fuels as soon as possible.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Invest in renewable energy. 
              <ul>
                <li> Changing our main energy sources to clean and renewable energy is the best way to stop using fossil fuels. These include technologies like solar, wind, wave, tidal and geothermal power.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Switch to sustainable transport. 
              <ul>
                <li> Petrol and diesel vehicles, planes and ships use fossil fuels. Reducing car use, switching to electric vehicles and minimising plane travel will not only help stop climate change, it will reduce air pollution too.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Invest in renewable energy. 
              <ul>
                <li> Changing our main energy sources to clean and renewable energy is the best way to stop using fossil fuels. These include technologies like solar, wind, wave, tidal and geothermal power.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Improve farming and encourage vegan diets.
              <ul>
                <li>  One of the best ways for individuals to help stop climate change is by reducing their meat and dairy consumption, or by going fully vegan. Businesses and food retailers can improve farming practices and provide more plant-based products to help people make the shift.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Reduce how much people consume.
              <ul>
                <li>Our transport, fashion, food and other lifestyle choices all have different impacts on the climate. This is often by design – fashion and technology companies, for example, will release far more products than are realistically needed. But while reducing consumption of these products might be hard, it’s most certainly worth it. Reducing overall consumption in more wealthy countries can help put less strain on the planet. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Reduce plastic.
              <ul>
                <li>Plastic is made from oil, and the process of extracting, refining and turning oil into plastic (or even polyester, for clothing) is surprisingly carbon-intense. It doesn’t break down quickly in nature so a lot of plastic is burned, which contributes to emissions. Demand for plastic is rising so quickly that creating and disposing of plastics will account for 17% of the global carbon budget by 2050 (this is the emissions count we need to stay within according to the Paris agreement).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
